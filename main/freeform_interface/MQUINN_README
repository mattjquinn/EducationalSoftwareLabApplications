This directory is the `ui` directory of the
forked EduBlocks project, customized to allow free-form
programs in NyokaTofali outside of competition mode.
Although it lives inside the encompassing Django project,
it is just a collection of static files and is therefore
aliased directly from the nginx configuration file.

ALSO NOTE: Many of the files in this directory are not needed,
but instead are relics from when the project was tightly coupled
with the nodejs/yarn backend.
